# Amaranthus (Working Title)

'Amaranthus' is a  document database and 
reference tool focused on intelligent cross-referencing, data visualisation,
flexibility, and transparency.

It uses flat file serialisation to store information in a way that is both
readable and accessable, but also allows for aggregation, processing and searching. 
The good parts of both worlds. 

It uses [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and 
[D3.JS](https://d3js.org/) to provide a cross-platform interface and visualisation, 
and a custom backend written on top of Node to handle document processing.
